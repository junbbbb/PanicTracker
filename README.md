- Secure Hive database implementation

## 🏥 Medical Foundation

### **Clinical Standards Implementation**
This app implements real medical standards used in panic disorder research and treatment:

#### **Primary Endpoints (FDA Approved)**
- **Panic Attack Frequency**: Weekly/monthly episode count (most important metric)
- **Panic Attack Intensity**: Average severity on 10-point scale
- **Treatment Response Rate**: 50%+ symptom improvement ratio

#### **Secondary Endpoints**
- **Avoidance Behavior Reduction**: Daily activity participation
- **Anticipatory Anxiety**: Fear of future attacks
- **Episode Duration**: Average attack length
- **Quality of Life**: Functional improvement (work/social)

#### **Management Score Algorithm**
```
Base Score (10) - (Avg Intensity - 1) × 0.5 - Excess Frequency × 0.5 - Duration Penalty
```
- Accounts for frequency, intensity, and duration
- Provides 0-10 composite wellness score
- Used in clinical trials for progress tracking

### **Evidence-Based Features**
- **Weekly Monitoring**: Medical standard for panic disorder tracking
- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term pattern recognition (6+ weeks recommended)
- **Improvement Metrics**: Week-over-week comparison for treatment efficacy
- **Clinical Insights**: Automated feedback based on symptom patterns
